Broadband-Router-DHCP-Dump-and-Ping
===================================

Queries the Verizon Actiontec MI424WR Wireless Broadband Router for the DHCP table and pings each device.

I use these scripts with GeekTools to list all devices in the DHCP table and ping for active devices.

Make sure to update get_dhcp.sh with your router's admin username and password.
